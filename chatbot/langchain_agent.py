Generate a SQL query to answer the following question.

--- VERY IMPORTANT SYNTAX RULES ---
1.  **NO HARDCODED NUMBERS**: You are strictly forbidden from using any hardcoded numbers in your query, especially for filtering or calculations.
2.  **AGGREGATION RULE**: When using an aggregate function (like SUM, AVG), any other columns in the SELECT clause MUST either be inside another aggregate function or be listed in the GROUP BY clause.
3.  **ROUNDING**: To round a calculation, you MUST use this exact syntax: `ROUND((...calculation...)::numeric, 2)`.
4.  **ALIASES**: When using a JOIN, every table must be given an alias (e.g., FROM budget_transaction AS bt), and every column must be prefixed with that alias.
5.  **FILTERING**: Always filter by `tenant_company_id = '{company_id}'`.
6.  **JOIN LOGIC**: If a JOIN is needed, you MUST use: `JOIN account_categories ac ON (bt.category_id = ac.id OR bt.sub_category_id = ac.id)`.
